Hey Friends! Meet your Photographer...Me! Shika Johnson! I am a professional photographer based in Orlando, Florida; however, my services are not limited to Central Florida alone but also around the globe. (basically, I travel too ðŸ˜Š ) I am known for my stunning portraiture and editorial-style photography. With over a decade of experience, I have a keen eye for capturing the essence of my subjects, whether it be a person, place, or event.

My passion for photography began at a young age when I received my first camera as a gift on a Sunday after church service. I quickly fell in love with the art of capturing moments and soon started taking photos of the family and friends and other church members too. As I grew older, my passion for photography only intensified. I considered studying photography in college, but after two years I changed my career path and enlisted in the United States Army and served as an Aviation Operation Specialist for 8 years. Even while enlisted I did not entirely leave photography behind, I found many opportunities to take photos of deployment ceremonies and chain of command ceremonies, and my work was even featured in the local newspapers.

After leaving the Army, I moved to Orlando and began my career as a freelance photographer, working on various projects. After a few years of freelancing, I realized I wanted to take photography seriously, and that's when I started SoShika Photography, LLC. I took my passions as a child and made it my dream career. Since, my work has been featured in numerous publications, including Malvie Magazine, MOB Journals, and VZSN, to name a few.

When I'm not behind the camera, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my family. My dedication to my craft and my ability to capture the beauty in the everyday have brought me closer to the levels of photography that I dreamed of as a little girl. I continue to strive to push the boundaries of what is possible with my art and inspire others to see the world through a different lens.
